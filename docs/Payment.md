# How do I keep my number running?
All DTel numbers has a monthly cost of 500 credits. You may renew in 2 ways:

* **Automatic**: 500 credits will be deducted every month from the account of the number's owner (Server owner or DM user) on the day of the expiry.
* **Manual**: Type `>dial *233` in the channel that has DTel service enabled, then type the amount of months you want to renew for. It costs 500 credits to extend a number by a month.

## Check your balance
You can use `>balance` in any channel, even the channel doesn't have DTel service enabled. The server must have DTel added, though.

## Earn some balance
